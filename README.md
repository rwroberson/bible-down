This script can be used alongside [jgclark's BibleGateway-to-Markdown](https://github.com/jgclark/BibleGateway-to-Markdown) and [bontibon's kjv](https://github.com/bontibon/kjv) to create a command-line Bible for any version available on Bible Gateway.

This will not download any Apocryphal books with Bibles that have them, although the script could be easily modified to handle.

NOTE: This has not been tested on non-English translations.
